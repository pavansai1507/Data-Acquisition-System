# Data-Acquisition-System
 It is an embedded system project designed for the LPC2129 microcontroller, which integrates various functionalities for a data acquisition system. It initializes several peripherals, including I2C for real-time clock (RTC) communication, SPI for reading data from an MCP3204 ADC, UART for serial communication, and an LCD for displaying information.
 Final result shows the Light intensity of LDR sensor which shows in 0-100%. In dark places it shows less when compared to other places.
